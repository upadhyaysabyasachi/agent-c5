Unlike simple chatbots that just respond to queries, agents can use tools, maintain memory across interactions, and reason through multi-step problems. The key characteristics of an agent include: autonomy (operating without constant human intervention), reactivity (responding to changes in the environment), proactivity (taking initiative to achieve goals), and social ability (interacting with other agents or humans). Modern AI agents typically use Large Language Models (LLMs) as their reasoning engine, combined with tools, memory systems, and structured prompts."

      "result": "Title: RAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation\nContent: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines information retrieval with language model generation. The process works in three steps: First, the user query is converted into a vector embedding. Second, this embedding is used to search a vector database for semantically similar content. Third, the retrieved content is provided as context to the LLM, which generates a response grounded in this information. RAG solves the knowledge cutoff problem of LLMs and reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in actual documents. Key components include an embedding model, a vector database (like Pinecone, Weaviate, or pgvector), and a retrieval strategy.\n\nTitle: Vector Embeddings Explained\nContent: Vector embeddings are numerical representations of text (or other data) that capture semantic meaning. Words, sentences, or documents with similar meanings have embeddings that are close together in vector space. Popular embedding models include OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small, Sentence Transformers, and Cohere embeddings. The process: text is passed through an embedding model, which outputs a fixed-size vector (e.g., 1536 dimensions). These vectors enable semantic search by comparing cosine similarity between query and document embeddings. Embeddings are fundamental to RAG systems and semantic memory.\n\nTitle: Agent Evaluation and Testing\nContent: Evaluating agents requires measuring multiple dimensions: Task completion rate (did the agent achieve the goal?), efficiency (how many steps/tokens were used?), accuracy (were the responses correct?), and safety (did the agent avoid harmful actions?). Testing strategies include unit tests for individual tools, integration tests for the agent loop, and evaluation datasets with expected outputs. Frameworks like RAGAS can evaluate RAG quality. For production, monitoring and logging are essential to track agent behavior, identify failure modes, and improve performance over time.",
